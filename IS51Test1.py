We need to decide which form of payment is higher, Option1 or Option2
Option1 is 100 dollars a day for ten days
Option2 is 1 dollar the first day then doubles each day (1,2,4,8, etc)
First we need to calulate the total pay for each option
Option1 = 100 * 10
Option2 = (1+2+4+8, etc) till list indexs reachs 9
If option1 == option2, then print "Option1 and Option2 pays the same"
Then, if option one is higher print "Option1 is better" to the console
Else print "Option2 is better"
end
